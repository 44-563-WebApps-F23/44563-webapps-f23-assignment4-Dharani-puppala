    <h5>HELMER:</h5>
    <br>
    <P>_[calls out from his room]_. </P>
        <P>Is that my little lark twittering out
            there?</P>
    <br>
   <h5>NORA:</h5> 
    <br>
    <P>_[busy opening some of the parcels]_. </P>
    <P>Yes, it is!</P>
     <br>
    <h5>HELMER:</h5>
    <br>
    <P>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</P>
    <br>
    <h5>NORA:</h5>
    <br>
    <P>Yes!</P>
    <br>
    <h5>HELMER:</h5>
    <br>
    <P>When did my squirrel come home?</P>
    <br>
   <h5>NORA:</h5> 
    <br>
    <P>Just now.  </P>
        <P>_[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
            mouth.]_</P>
            <P>Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</P>
    <br>
    <h5>HELMER:</h5>
    <br>
    <P>Don’t disturb me. </P>
        <P>_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
            the room, pen in hand.]_ </P>
            <P>Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
                little spendthrift been wasting money again?</P>
